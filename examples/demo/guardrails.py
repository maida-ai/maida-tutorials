"""
Guardrails demo: stop_on_loop saves a runaway agent.

Shows how Maida's stop_on_loop guardrail intercepts a stuck ReAct-style
agent loop before it burns more tokens. The trace captures the full evidence
(all events up to and including the LOOP_WARNING that tripped the guardrail),
so you can inspect exactly what pattern repeated.

Run from repo root:
   uv run python -m examples.demo.guardrails
Then:
   maida view

    Simulate a ReAct-style agent that gets stuck retrying the same search.

    A real agent would update its query based on the response, but this one
